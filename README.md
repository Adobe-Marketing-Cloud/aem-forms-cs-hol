# AEM Forms CS Hands-on Labs Resources

This repository contains materials for the AEM Forms CS Hands-on Labs (HOLs) including resources
and other such assets to help deliver a more customized lab experience. 

## PROJECT NAME: AEM Forms CS Hands-on Labs

Hands-on Labs (HOLs) are consultant lead sessions to get in-tool access and exercises within AEM Forms CS.

## Goals

As the general HOL offering will continue to grow over time, so too will the  lab content.

## Non-Goals

It is also a good idea to declare what are _not_ goals of the project to prevent
potential feature creep.

## Usage

The lab content is designed to cater to different industry verticals for AEM Forms.
